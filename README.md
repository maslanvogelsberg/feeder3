This is a repository containing instructional materials on how to examine the data Repository set *County Health Data*

### This repository covers 
- Basic instructions in the coding process through the Python Coding Package *County Health Data*. 
- Filtering through data in the Python Coding Package "County Health Data" to find trends throughout and the data, and use this research make meaningful decisions to better North Carolina! . 

### Summary of the Data
This data is a public repository from the County Health Department of the United States. This data goes through every county in every state of the United States, comparing different rates among counties such as of deaths, diseases, food disparities, etc. 
Yet this specific repository will use the data repository set to look more into North Carolina counties using a random sample.

### Uses of the dataset
- This repository was made for the people and government of the great state of North Carolina, to look into the different rates of discrepancies between counties, and to make changes according to these trends found within data. This repository may be used for research, evidence in comparison, evidence for certain political steps, etc.

### What we are trying to find
- Through filtering through our data, we hope to prove the discrepancies between the percent of uninsured adults and the amount of teen births a year in North Carolina. By comparing the percent of uninsured citizens in a North Carolina county to thier amount of teen births, we see a trend in our data. The higher the amount of uninsured, the higher the amount of teen births. We hope to use this data, which is shown in the chart below to harvest change. While this data is open to the public, our main goal is to make policy changes in the North Carolina government to increase every county's health in North Carolina. Let's look our data, which was taken as a random sample (n=19) from all our 200 NC counties.
