This is a repository containing instructional materials on how to examine the data Repository set *County Health Data*. 
### [Download the County Health Data Set as a csv](https://github.com/maslanvogelsberg/feeder3/files/10063026/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.3.csv)


### This repository covers 
- Basic instructions in the coding process through the Python Coding Package *County Health Data*. 
- Filtering through data in the Python Coding Package "County Health Data" to find trends throughout the data and in turn use this research to make meaningful decisions to better the health of North Carolina!

### What does this data show?  
This data is a public repository from the County Health Department of the United States. This data goes through every county in every state of the United States and  compares the different factors of health among counties such as of deaths, diseases, food disparities, etc. 
Yet in this speific repository will use the dataset to look more into health disparities in North Carolina. 

### Why are we filtering our dataset?
Filtering our North Carolina data into a random sample, we will look into the correlation between the percent of uninsured citizens in a county and the amount of teen births. Lower rates of post-secondary education are seen by teen parents compared to teenagers who are not parents. With the usage of this data, we hope to see the state increase oppurtunities for citizen's insurance coverage and a more affordable access to family planning products such as birth control, condoms, etc. 

### Uses of the dataset
- This repository was made for the people and government of the great state of North Carolina. This data's main purpose is to show discrepancies in health practices between counties, and to make changes according to the trends found within the data. This repository may be used for research, evidence in comparison, evidence for certain political steps, etc.

### What we found
- By comparing the percent of uninsured citizens in a North Carolina county to thier amount of teen births, we see a trend in our data. The higher the percent of uninsured citizens in a county, the higher the amount of teen births in the county. We hope this data is used in the chart to harvest change. While this data is open to the public, our main goal is to make policy changes in the North Carolina government to increase every county's health in North Carolina. Let's look our data, which was taken as a random sample (n=19) from all our 200 NC counties.
